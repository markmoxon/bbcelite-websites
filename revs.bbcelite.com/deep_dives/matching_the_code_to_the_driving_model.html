						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">Tracking down the driving model features that are mentioned in the manual</h2>

						<p>When disassembling a complex game like Revs, you take every clue you can get. This is particularly true when there are no prior analyses out there, as was the case when I pulled apart both Aviator and Revs. You're pretty much on your own when all you have to go on is the game binary and the box it came in.</p>

						<p>Aviator, though, did come with a very big clue, in the form of a long and detailed list of every aspect of the flying model, right there in the game manual. It was so useful that I ended up matching every single clue to the in-game code as I analysed the flight model; you can read all about this in the deep dive on <a href="https://aviator.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/matching_the_code_to_the_flight_model.html">matching Aviator's code to the flight model</a>.</p>

						<p>Inspired by my experience with Aviator, I thought I'd try the same with Revs. This is how it went.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Clues from the Revs manual<br />
													 --------------------------</h2>

						<p>Aviator's section on the flight model is so detailed, it's almost as if the manual's authors took the code-level specification for the game's physics engine and pasted it straight onto the page.</p>

						<p>With Revs, the clues are few and far between, and some of them are fairly vague. Still, here's a comprehensive list of all the clues I can find in the manual, along with links to the relevant code and deep dives. Note that these represent my best guesses, so take the following with a healthy pinch of salt!</p>

						<p>On top of this, the race programme contains David Hunt's recommended approach and braking speeds for various corners. These broadly match the figures in the track data file, and specifically the value of trackSectionSpeed in <a href="/source/silverstone/variable/track_section_data_part_1_of_2.html">part 1 of the track section data</a>, which sets the maximum speed for non-player drivers in the track sections before each of the corners (i.e. the track section for the approach).</p>

						<p>Here's a comparison of the manual's speed range and the relevant approach section's speed from the track data file (corners not mentioned in the table below can be taken flat out):</p>

						<table class="spacedTableBorder codeSummary">
							<tr class="codeSummaryHeader"><th>Section #</th><th>Approaching</th><th>Speed in manual</th><th>Speed in track data</th></tr>
							<tr><td>0</td><td>Woodcote</td><td>139 down to 117</td><td>136</td></tr>
							<tr><td>4</td><td>Copse</td><td>134 down to 122</td><td>125</td></tr>
							<tr><td>11</td><td>Becketts</td><td>137 down to 105</td><td>116</td></tr>
							<tr><td>17</td><td>Stowe</td><td>139</td><td>139</td></tr>
							<tr><td>19</td><td>Club</td><td>137</td><td>151</td></tr>
						</table>

						<p>The figures are reasonably close, though there is a bit of discrepancy at Club Corner, where non-player drivers are happy to take the corner at 151 mph, rather faster than David Hunt's recommended 137 mph. But for the other corners, it appears that the maximum speeds taken by the computer-controlled drivers are based on David Hunt's own driving technique, as described by the man himself in the racing programme. That's a nice touch!</p>
