						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">The calculations behind losing grip and squealing tyres</h2>

						<p>This article details the extra calculations that the driving model performs when either the front or rear tyres are skidding. It is designed to be read alongside the <a href="the_core_driving_model.html">core driving model calculations</a>.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader"><a id="calculation9" class="anchor"></a>Calculation 9: Apply rear tyre skidding<br>
						---------------------------------------</h2>

						<p>This is an explanation of calculation 9 in the driving model. It might help to <a href="the_core_driving_model.html#calculation9">see calculation 9 in context</a>.</p>

						<p>If the rear tyres are squealing (i.e. bit 7 of tyreSqueal is set) or the rear tyres were squealing in the last iteration of the main driving loop (i.e. bit 6 of tyreSqueal is set), then we make the sound of the tyres squealing and do the following calculations.</p>

						<p><i>See code: <a href="/source/main/subroutine/applyskidforces.html">ApplySkidForces</a></i></p>

						<p>First, we recalculate the sideways force due to the sliding rear wheels, using a similar equation to the one we used for calculating the z-axis force in <a href="the_core_driving_model.html#calculation9">calculation 8</a>, but this time in the x-axis and with a different calculation for (A T):</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  (NN MM) = scaled up |xVelocity|

  (A T) = wingForce95 &lt;&lt; 8

  xTyreForceRear = max((A T), (NN MM)) * abs(-xVelocity)
</pre>

						<p>The abs(-xVelocity) ensures that the force is against the direction of travel along the x-axis.</p>

						<p><i>See code: <a href="/source/main/subroutine/gettyreforces.html">GetTyreForces</a></i></p>

						<p>Next, we recalculate the force along the z-axis, starting by calculating the variables that we use in the calculation:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If the throttle is being applied:

<pre class="articleIndented">  (A T) = (throttleBrake * engineTorque) / 2
</pre>

								where throttleBrake is the amount of throttle being applied, and engineTorque is the engine torque from the previous iteration of the main driving loop (as set in <a href="the_core_driving_model.html#calculation21">calculation 21</a>).
							</li>

							<li>If the throttle is not being applied:

<pre class="articleIndented">  (NN MM) = scaled up |zVelocity|

  (A T) = throttleBrake * wingForce
</pre>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p><i>See code: <a href="/source/main/subroutine/applyskidforces.html">ApplySkidForces</a></i></p>

						<p>Finally, we can recalculate the forces from the skidding rear tyre.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If A &gt;= wingForce95, set:

<pre class="articleIndented">  (A T) = wingForce95 &lt;&lt; 8

  xTyreForceRear = 0
</pre>
							</li>

							<li>If the throttle is being applied, set:

<pre class="articleIndented">  zTyreForceRear = (A T) * abs(gearNumber - 1)
</pre>

								where abs(gearNumber - 1) is negative for reverse gear, and positive for all other gears.

							</li>

							<li>If the throttle is not being applied, set:

<pre class="articleIndented">  zTyreForceRear = max((A T), (NN MM)) * abs(-zVelocity)
</pre>

							The abs(-zVelocity) ensures that the force is against the direction of travel along the z-axis.
							</li>
						</ul>

						-----------------------------------------</h2>

						<p>This is an explanation of calculation 11 in the driving model. It might help to <a href="the_core_driving_model.html#calculation11">see calculation 11 in context</a>.</p>

						<p>If the front tyres are squealing (i.e. bit 7 of tyreSqueal is set) or the front tyres were squealing in the last iteration of the main driving loop (i.e. bit 6 of tyreSqueal is set), then we make the sound of the tyres squealing and do the following calculations.</p>

						<p><i>See code: <a href="/source/main/subroutine/gettyreforces.html">GetTyreForces</a></i></p>

						<p>Next, we recalculate the force along the z-axis, starting by calculating the variables that we use in the calculation:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If the throttle is being applied, stop applying the skidding calculations and jump to <a href="the_core_driving_model.html#calculation12">calculation 12</a>.</li>

							<li>If the throttle is not being applied:

<pre class="articleIndented">  (NN MM) = scaled up |zVelocity|

<pre class="articleIndented">  (A T) = throttleBrake * wingForce * 3 / 4

  zTyreForceNose = max((A T), (NN MM)) * abs(-zVelocity)
