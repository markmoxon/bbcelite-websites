						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">The sequence of events in the main game loop</h2>

						<p>Here is a high-level look at the main program flow, from the first menu to the end of a race. For more information on the loading process that precedes the first menu, see the deep dive on <a href="the_jigsaw_puzzle_binary.html">the jigsaw puzzle binary</a>.</p>

						<p>Each section is broken down into parts that mirror the structure of the source code, so it should be easy enough to find the relevant parts mentioned below.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Main game loop<br />
													 --------------</h2>

						<p>The main game loop starts when we begin a new game, and restarts when we press SHIFT and right arrow.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Main driving loop<br />
													 -----------------</h2>

						<p>The main driving loop takes over when we go to the track to do a practice lap or join a race.</p>

						<p>It is joined from the main game loop by calling the <a href="/source/main/subroutine/headtotrack.html">HeadToTrack</a> routine, which asks for the wing settings and calls the main driving loop at <a href="/source/main/subroutine/maindrivingloop_part_1_of_5.html">MainDrivingLoop</a>. It also deals with the exit from the main driving loop, whether we choose to return to the pits (in which case it shows the wing settings menu again), or when the race has ended (in which case it returns to the main game loop).</p>

						<p><a href="/source/main/subroutine/maindrivingloop_part_1_of_5.html">1/5: Main driving loop (Part 1 of 5)</a></p>
