						<img class="titleImage" style="width: 320px" src="/images/general/Revs.png" alt="BBC Micro Revs screenshot">

						<p>This site contains reconstructed source code for Revs, Geoff Crammond's epic Formula 3 racing simulator for the BBC Micro, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Revs and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate the first proper racing simulator and the grandfather of modern sim racing.</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not Geoff Crammond's original source code, as that hasn't been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that's been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

						                             --------------------------</h2>

						<p>To start your journey into the secrets of Revs, you might like to try the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>See the <a href="/about_site/quick_start_guide.html">quick start guide</a> to find out how to use this site.</li>

							<li>Find out how to <a href="/playing_revs/">play Revs in your browser</a> or by using an emulator.</li>

							<li>Read more <a href="/about_site/about_this_project.html">about this project</a> and how it came to be.</li>

							<li>Check out the <a href="/deep_dives/">deep dive articles</a> for lots of details about how Revs works under the hood.</li>

							<li>Dive straight into the <a href="/source/articles/map_of_the_source_code.html">source code</a>, though you might want to <a href="/about_site/terminology_used_in_this_commentary.html">read these notes</a> first, which explain some of the terminology used in the commentary.</li>

							<li>Jump straight to a <a href="/cgi-bin/random.cgi">random routine from the source code</a> - who knows where you might end up? You can also click the &#x221E; at the top of the page to keep jumping through the source code; it's a good way to explore.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you prefer a lighter theme for your Revs explorations, you can change the site's colour scheme by clicking the icons in the top-right corner.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">If you want to play with the code<br>
						                             ---------------------------------</h2>

						<p>If you are interested in building a working copy of Revs from the source, then you'll enjoy exploring the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/revs-source-code-bbc-micro">accompanying GitHub repository</a>, which contains fully commented and buildable source code for Revs.</p>
            
						<p>This repository can be <a href="/about_site/building_revs.html">assembled on modern computers</a> to produce a working game disc that can be loaded into a BBC Micro or an emulator. If you want to experiment with the code, this is the place to go.</p>
