						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">Using a library repository to generate and compare seven versions of Elite</h2>

						<p>The article on <a href="generating_websites.html">generating websites from source code</a> explains how I generate the Aviator, Revs and Lander websites from their corresponding source code repositories. But what about the Elite site?</p>

						<p>In terms of the source code pages that are common to all my disassembly sites, the same approach is used. Just as in the other sites, the mammoth <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts/blob/main/disassembly-website-generator/create-disassembly-websites.py">create-disassembly-websites.py</a> script takes each of the Elite source code repositories - one for each version of Elite - and generates HTML pages containing the source code, all marked-up and cross-referenced and ready to deploy to the website along with the static website content from the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-websites/">bbc-websites</a> repository. There is one extra function call that supports the addition of a comparison link to the subroutine headers, but apart from that the process is the same.</p>

						<p>There's an awful lot more going on with the Elite site, though, and that's what we're going to look at here.</p>

						<p>As discussed in the <a href="index.html">overview</a>, here's the flowchart for producing the Elite site:</p>

</pre>

						<p>In the bottom-left corner you can see the same generation process that's used to produce the other sites - the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts/blob/main/disassembly-website-generator/create-disassembly-websites.py">create-disassembly-websites.py</a> script ingests the source code from a repository, and generates the code pages, indexes and statistics pages, just like the Aviator, Revs and Lander sites. The only difference here is that there are seven source code repositories, one for each version of Elite, so for Elite we just run the script seven times, passing a different parameter to the script on each run.</p>

						<p>On the right side you can see the same process of combining the generated content with the static content from the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-websites/">bbc-websites</a> repository - that's the same as in the other sites, too, there's just more hand-crafted content. The idea is the same, though.</p>

						<p>There are two new processes in this flowchart, though:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>In the top-left corner, the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts/blob/main/elite-repository-generator/create-elite-repositories.py">create-elite-repositories.py</a> script generated the contents of the seven source code repositories from the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/library-elite-beebasm">library-elite-beebasm</a> repository. In the other sites the source code repositories are hand-crafted, but in Elite they are generated by script.</li>

							<li>In the middle column, the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts/blob/main/disassembly-website-generator/create-disassembly-websites.py">create-disassembly-websites.py</a> script that we used to create source code pages also produces the compare section of the website, but this time it ingests the content from the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/library-elite-beebasm">library-elite-beebasm</a> repository.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>We're going to look at both of these processes in this article, but first let's take a quick look at the shell script that joins everything in the flowvhart together.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">A deeper look at the website generation process<br />
													 -----------------------------------------------</h2>

						<p>The Elite site is updated by running the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts/blob/main/generate-elite.sh">generate-elite.sh</a> script. As with the other sites, if you want to have a go at running this process yourself, then the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/bbcelite-scripts">bbcelite-scripts</a> repository contains step-by-step instructions on setting up and running the scripts yourself. The process has been built on a Mac, but it wouldn't take much effort to get it working on Linux or Windows.</p>

						<p>This shell script is quite a bit bigger than the equivalent scripts for Aviator, Revs and Lander, but the structure is pretty similar - it just looks bigger because the Elite site is effectively seven websites rolled into one.</p>
