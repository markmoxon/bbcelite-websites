						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">The advantages of generating disassembly websites from the source code</h2>

						<p>Back in the first lockdown of 2020, I started poking around inside the BBC Micro version of Elite. Pulling apart 8-bit code from a bygone era gave me a zen-like refuge from the outside world, and that's when I fell in love with the art of disassembly.</p>

						<p>To be honest, I got carried away, but those were strange times. You can read the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/about_site/about_this_project.html">full story on my Elite website</a>, but the first release back in August 2020 consisted of a huge text file containing fully buildable source code for the cassette version of BBC Micro Elite, with every single line explained. I also inserted a number of deep dives into the source, and the resulting 1.6MB text file ran to 41,274 lines of lovingly crafted homage to this epic game.</p>

						<p>I <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/cassette-elite-beebasm/tree/d7ce8248ee52dc2d0f7e421cc353f1dcf15c8e68">uploaded the first version of the source to GitHub</a>, and people liked it. I was pretty happy with how that initial release turned out, and it still looks great in an old-school terminal with an 80-column width:</p>

						<p>Unfortunately the main source file was too large to browse properly on GitHub; you can view much larger files in GitHub these days, but back then the only viewing option was to download the raw text file. So I knocked together a quick Python script to extract the code from the source files and produce a much friendlier website version, which included handy features like cross-references and popup information. This is what the the same <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/main/subroutine/tis2.html">TIS2 routine</a> looks like on the Elite website:</p>

						<img class="titleImage" style="width: 390px" src="/images/disassembly/tis2.png" alt="The TIS2 routine in the BBC Micro Elite website" />



						<p>In the process I also removed the deep dives from the source files and published them on the website instead, and the resulting website proved pretty popular (here's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24611341">what people thought on Hacker News</a>).</p>

						<p>And then there was a second lockdown in late 2020, so I turned to the 6502 Second Processor source code and started pulling that version apart. It was obvious from early on that there was an awful lot of shared code between the cassette version and the 6502 Second Processor version, and after a few attempts to copy the comments from my cassette commentary into the source for the co-processor version, I wondered if there might be a better way of doing this.</p>

						<p>So I created a single repository to contain the source code for both versions, with as much content sharing as possible and using conditional logic to build both versions from the same repository. This grew into the library project of commented Elite code at <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/library-elite-beebasm">library-elite-beebasm</a>, and I built a second Python script to generate the fully documented source code for both versions, using the library as a single source of truth. The <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/6502sp/">6502 Second Processor commentary</a> went live in early 2021.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">The project that keeps on giving<br />
													 --------------------------------</h2>

						<p>The Elite project has grown rather a lot since then. It now covers seven distinct versions of the game, and each of these has its own repository containing the fully documented and buildable source code for that version. These repositories are still generated from the central library, which now contains commented source code for all seven versions, and the Elite website not only has source code for all seven versions, but it also has indexes, cross-references and statistics for each of those versions, as well as a section that compares the main Acornsoft releases on a line-by-line basis, so you can see exactly what the differences are between the versions.</p>

						<p>To put this in context, at the time of writing (summer 2024), the Elite site contains 7,653 web pages. Of these, 171 are hand-crafted; this total includes over 100 <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/">deep dives</a>, a <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/">hacks</a> section, <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/about_site/quick_start_guide.html">site information</a>, the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/">various pages</a> describing the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/compare/versions_of_elite.html">different versions</a> of the game</a>. The other 7,482 pages are generated by the first Python script that I originally knocked out in a hurry in September 2020, which still ingests the Elite source code repositories to create the bulk of the website that you see today.</p>

						<p>The same script also produces the code sections of the <a href="https://aviator.bbcelite.com">Aviator</a>, <a href="https://revs.bbcelite.com">Revs</a> and <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com">Lander</a> websites, again taking the code from their respective source code repositories. Meanwhile, the second Python script that I wrote still creates the Elite source code repositories from the Elite library repository... but there are seven of them now, one for each version of Elite that I've analysed.</p>

						<p>You can find out how these two scripts work by reading the <a href="overview.html">overview of how these scripts work</a>, and you can dive more deeply into the scripts themselves in the articles on <a href="generating_websites.html">generating websites from source code</a> and <a href="generating_elite.html">generating source code for Elite</a>.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">What this all means<br />
													 -------------------</h2>

						<p>The upshot of all of this scripting is that if I want to update a comment in the Elite source, then I can make my changes in just one place in the library repository and then run a shell single script. This process updates the comment in the relevant source code repositories, as well as updating the comment wherever it appears in the website.</p>

						<p>As an example, consider the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/main/subroutine/bline.html">BLINE</a> circle-drawing routine, which appears in every version of Elite, with only minor differences between the different platforms. If I make a change to this routine, in a comment for example, then the script will update that comment in all seven source code repositories, and it will also update the comment on 23 different pages across the website, all automatically. Here's a list of all the places that get updated, even if I make no more than a tiny change to BLINE:</p>

						</ul>

						<p>So for one small change in the library repository, the script will update seven code repositories (which may contain multiple occurrences of the updated content), 11 individual source code pages, 11 large source code pages, and one comparison web page. Updating these pages manually would be an unreliable and painful process; running a single shell script is about as easy as it gets.</p>

						<p>To put it another way, without these scripts, then either this website would exist, or my sanity... but not both.</p>
