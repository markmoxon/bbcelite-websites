						<p>This deep dive is being written - it should be ready in a day or two.</p>

						<!--

						<p>The launch of BBC Micro Elite drew a line in the sand: you either had a disc drive, or you missed out. Prior to this, games were pretty much the same on disc or cassette, with the obvious difference that games loaded in seconds from disc while they took minutes to load from tape. But waiting aside, the gaming experience was the same.</p>

						<p>Elite blew all of this out of the water. The cassette version of Elite was great, and squeezed every ounce of performance out of the BBC's 32K of RAM (leaving almost no free memory in its wake - see the <a href="the_elite_memory_map.html">BBC Micro cassette Elite memory map</a> for details). I started on the cassette version, and fell in love with it. But for those of us poring over the manual and control guide, it hurt to be a lowly tape user, because a noticeable number of features had asterisks by them, indicating that they were only present in the disc version.</p>

						<p>More ships! Military lasers! Asteroid mining! Extended system descriptions! Better enemy tactics! Missions! A proper docking computer! Bitstik support! The list went on. And OK, perhaps nobody really cared about the last one, but this exotic menu of extra features was utterly mouthwatering for those of with our noses pressed up against the glass. To see what I mean, check out the <a href="/compare/feature_comparison.html">feature comparison table</a> for a comprehensive list of all the extre features.</p>

						<p>I, like many others, starting saving up for a disc drive specifically to play the enhanced disc version of Elite, and although it took ages to get there, it was worth every single penny. The BBC Micro disc version is now regarded as the canonical version of Elite, and quite right too.</p>

						<p>In this article, we'll take a look at how Bell and Braben managed to fit so many extra features into the disc version, by splitting the codebase into two parts: the docked code and the flight code.</p>

						<p>If you look at the disc contents for Elite, there are an awful lot of files on there:</p>
