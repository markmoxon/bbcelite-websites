https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6271/what-determines-the-color-of-every-8th-pixel-on-the-apple-ii

From Apple II Reference Manual:

A total of 280 dots are displayed on each of the 192 lines of the screen.

* If a bit is "off", its corresponding dot will always be black.

* If a bit is "on", however, its color will depend upon the position of that dot on the screen.

How to work out the colour of a dot:

* If the dot is in the leftmost column on the screen, called "column 0", or in any even-numbered column, then it will appear violet.

* If the dot is in the rightmost column (column 279) or any odd-numbered column, then it will appear green.

* If two dots are placed side-by-side, they will both appear white.

* If the undisplayed bit of a byte is turned on, then the colors blue and red are substituted for violet and green, respectively. Thus, there are six colors available in the High Resolution Graphics mode, subject to the following limitations:

  Dots in even columns must be black, violet, or blue.

  Dots in odd columns must be black, green, or red.

Each byte must be either a violet/green byte or a blue/red byte. It is not possible to mix green and blue, green and red, violet and blue, or violet and red in the same byte.

* Two colored dots side by side always appear white, even if they are in different bytes.
