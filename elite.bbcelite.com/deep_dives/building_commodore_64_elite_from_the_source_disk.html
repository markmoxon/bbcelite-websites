LODATA = P.WORDS + C.FONT + C.IANTOK
COMLOD = LODATA + C.SHIPS + COMLODS (DEEOR) + C.CODIALS + C.SPRITE + C.DATE4

LOCODE = ELTA + ELTB + ELTC
HICODE = ELTD + ELTE + ELTF + ELTG + ELTH + ELTI + ELTJ + ELTK

gma4 = COMLOD
gma5 = LOCODE
gma6 = HICODE + C.THEME

gma1 does the following:
  Load gma3 at &C800, call it for disk protection (disabled by checksum.py)
  Set up return address in &CE03
  Load gma4 at &4000, call it to decrypt itself & relocate the data it contains:
    LODATA to &0700
    SHIPS to &D000
    sdump to screen RAM + &2D0 (for dashboard)
    cdump to COLMEM + &2D0 (for dashboard)
    DIALS to STORE%
    Also sets up a load of screen palette stuff
    Then jumps back into gma1 via address in &CE03 (set up by gma1)
  Load gma5 at &1D00, stays there
  Load gma6 at &6A00, stays there
  Jump to start of main game code, which decrypts itself and runs

Files from GMA85 disc:
  firebird implements an auto-run that loads and calls gma1
  gma1 is the main loader: implements fast load and loads gma3, gma4, gma5, gma6
  gma2 is empty
  gma3 is all about disc protection - we can disable and ignore
    We disable the call to run this in gma1 to disable the protection:
    JSR &C800 -> NOPx3, BEQ -> BNE
    Or just the first one for NTSC version
  gma4 is game data and a decryption routine
  gma5 is low memory part of main game code, including a decryption routine
  gma6 is high memory part of main game code


Build process on original source disc
-------------------------------------

C.SHIPS (can be generated with CHAIN "S.CSHIPS" from individual ship files from Ian Bell's site, e.g. MISSILE, ANACONDA etc.)
CHAIN "S.CSHIPS"
-> :2.C.SHIPS

Pre-requisite files:
C.SHIPS
DIALS53
C.MUSDAT
C.FONT


Set machine to BBC Micro with 6502SP

Put disc in drive 0

SHIFT-CTRL-BREAK

CHAIN ":2.S.MUCOMPR"
C.MUSDAT -> :2.C.COMUDAT

*DRIVE 2

CHAIN "S.GENWORD"
-> :2.P.WORDS

CHAIN "S.IANTOKS"
-> :2.C.IANTOK

CHAIN "S.LODATAS" (just press Return at prompt)
P.WORDS, C.FONT, C.IANTOK -> :2.C.LODATA

CHAIN "S.SPRITES"
-> :2.C.SPRITE

CHAIN "S.CDATE4S"
-> :2.C.DATE4

*DIR $

CHAIN "$.MO5-COM"
DIALS53 -> :2.C.CODIALS

SHIFT-CTRL-BREAK

Press f0, Return: CHAIN "ELITEA" (just press Return at prompt)
A.ELITEA-K, C.COMUDAT -> :0.C.ELTA-K

Press f4, Return: CHAIN ":2.S.BCODES" (just press Return at prompt)
C.ELTA-K -> :2.HICODE, :2.LOCODE

HIMEM=&B800

CHAIN ":2.S.COMLODS"
C.LODATA, C.SHIPS, C.CODIALS, C.SPRITE, C.DATE4 -> C.COMLOD

Result = COMLOD (on disc 0), LOCODE, HICODE (on disc 2)

Then make final game disc from these three plus C.THEME (this process is not on the source disc) or transmit these files to a Commodore 64 using $.SEND


What the programs do
--------------------

C.ELITEA = C.ELITEA-K, C.COMUDAT -> ELTA to ELTK
S.BCODES = ELT* (on disc) -> LOCODE, HICODE (on disc as C.LOCODE, C.HICODE)
(S.HICODES = ELT* -> HICODE)

S.GENWORD -> P.WORDS (on disc)
S.IANTOKS -> IANTOK (on disc as C.IANTOK)
S.LODATAS = P.WORDS (on disc), C.FONT (on disc), C.IANTOK -> LODATA (on disc as C.LODATA)
S.CSHIPS -> C.SHIPS (on disc)
$.MO5-COM = DIALS53 (on disc) -> C.CODIALS (on disc)
S.SPRITES -> C.SPRITE (on disc)
S.CDATE4S -> C.DATE4
S.COMLODS = C.LODATA, C.SHIPS, C.CODIALS, C.SPRITE, C.DATE4 -> C.COMLOD (on disc)

S.THEMES = $.ELITE (missing) -> C.THEME (on disc)
S.MUCOMPR = C.MUSDAT (on disc) -> C.COMUDAT (on disc)

$.SEND sends a file to a Commodore 64
$.SCRNOP5 is an image editor
$.UNPACK analyses competition codes
