						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">The main algorithm behind Elite's many division routines</h2>

						<p>Elite implements division in routines like <a href="/cassette/main/subroutine/tis2.html">TIS2</a> using the shift-and-subtract algorithm (an approach which is used in other division routines, such as <a href="/cassette/main/subroutine/tis1.html">TIS1</a> and <a href="/cassette/main/subroutine/dvid4.html">DVID4</a>). This is similar in concept to the shift-and-add algorithm used to implement multiplication in routines like <a href="/cassette/main/subroutine/mult1.html">MULT1</a>, but it's essentially the reverse of that algorithm.</p>

						<p>In the same way that shift-and-add implements a binary version of the manual long multiplication process, shift-and-subtract implements long division. We shift bits out of the left end of the number being divided (A), subtracting the largest possible multiple of the divisor (Q) after each shift; each bit of A where we can subtract Q gives a 1 the answer to the division, otherwise it gives a 0.</p>

						<p>In pseudo-code, the algorithm to calculate T = P / Q (with remainder A) looks like this:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  T = 0
  A = 0
  for x = 7 to 0
    A = A &lt;&lt; 1
    A(bit 0) = P(bit x)
    if A &gt;= Q then
      A = A - Q
      T(bit x) = 1
</pre>

						<p>This is the algorithm implemented in TIS2, except we save space (and make things much more confusing) by using A for both the number being divided and the remainder, building the answer in T instead of P, and using set bits in T to implement the loop counter. The basic idea of shifting and subtracting is the same, though.</p>
