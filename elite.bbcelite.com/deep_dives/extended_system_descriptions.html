						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">The famous "goat soup" algorithm that generates those strange and wonderful system descriptions</h2>

						<p>The enhanced versions of Elite - all except the BBC Micro cassette and Electron versions, in other words - not only come with an <a href="extended_text_tokens.html">extended text token system</a> in addition to the <a href="printing_text_tokens.html">standard token system</a>, but they also support extended system descriptions. These appear at the bottom of the Data on System screen, so for Lave we get "Lave is most famous for its vast rain forests and the Lavian tree grub", like this:</p>

						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/disc/data_on_lave.png" alt="The Data on System screen for Lave in the BBC Micro disc version of Elite">

						<p>Some descriptions are fairly rudimentary: poor, unloved Rigeti, for example, is a "revolting dump":</p>

						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/disc/data_on_rigeti.png" alt="The Data on System screen for Rigeti in the BBC Micro disc version of Elite">

						<p>Other descriptions are simply bizarre. Raale is "very fabled for the Raalian edible poet":</p>

						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/disc/data_on_raale.png" alt="The Data on System screen for Raale in the BBC Micro disc version of Elite">

						<p>while the planet Tiinlebi is "most noted for the Tiinlebian mountain slug and its inhabitants' exceptiona loathing of food blenders":</p>

						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/disc/data_on_tiinlebi.png" alt="The Data on System screen for Tiinlebi in the BBC Micro disc version of Elite">

						<p>These extended system descriptions are generated by what game co-author Ian Bell calls the "goat soup" recipe, using nothing more than the power of the extended text token system. We take a look at the recipe below, but first a note on overrides.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">System description overrides<br>
													 ----------------------------</h2>

						<p>The extended system descriptions generated by the "goat soup" recipe described below can be overridden in certain circumstances, particularly during missions. These overrides are only shown if you are docked at the system in question, and they are shown in capital letters to attract attention.</p>

						<p>The rules for overriding an extended system description are as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If the current system number matches entry number n in the RUPLA table...</li>

							<li>And the galaxy number and mission status match entry number n in the RUGAL table...</li>

							<li>Then show token number n from the RUTOK table instead of the normal "goat soup" extended system description</li>
						</ul>

						<p>So, for example, if we are at Usleri in galaxy 1 during mission 1, then we match the eighth entries in the RUPLA and RUGAL tables, so we display the eighth token from the RUTOK table, which is:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  "YOU CAN TACKLE THE [170-174] [91-95] IF YOU LIKE. HE'S AT ORARRA"
</pre>

						<p>The two ERND tokens randomly expand into one each of the following lists:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>[170-174] = KILLER, DEADLY, EVIL, LETHAL, VICIOUS</li>

							<li>[91-95] = SON OF A BITCH, SCOUNDREL, BLACKGUARD, ROGUE, WHORESON BEETLE HEAD[ED ]FLAP EAR'D KNAVE</li>
						</ul>

						<p>so we could end up chasing a killer scoundrel, a lethal rogue, or even a vicious whoreson beetle headed flap ear'd knave (and refreshing the page by repeatedly pressing f6 will randomly run through all sorts of other combinations).</p>

						<p>Interestingly, the last invective is "WHORESON BEETLE HEADFLAP EAR'D KNAVE" in the disc version, but by the time of the 6502 Second Processor version, it had been changed to "WHORESON BEETLE HEADED FLAP EAR'D KNAVE". This is actually a quote from Shakespeare, specifically from Act 4 Scene 1 of The Taming of the Shrew, where Petruchio calls a servant "a whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!". So the 6502 Second Processor version contains the correct quote, unlike the original disc version. Sadly, the NES version changes it to a rather simple "WRETCH", which is just not the same.</p>

						<p>There are some other overrides of interest, all of which occur irrespective of mission status, so these will always be shown if you dock at the following systems:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Teorge in galaxy 1: "THE COLONISTS HERE HAVE VIOLATED INTERGALACTIC CLONING PROTOCOL AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED" (this is a reference to <cite>The Dark Wheel</cite>, the novella that came with the game; the character Elyssia Fields hails from Teorge, so this is a rare example of the novella influencing the game content, rather than the other way round)</li>

							<li>Arredi in galaxy 3: "COMING SOON: ELITE II" (actually, it would be nine more years before Elite II would hit the shelves, and it would be a rather different game to the original planned version of Elite II)</li>

							<li>Anreer in galaxy 3: "THE INHABITANTS OF ANREER ARE SO AMAZINGLY PRIMITIVE THAT THEY STILL THINK STILL THINK A*****R IS A PRETTY NEAT GAME" (this is a swipe at Aviator, which came out the year before Elite; it's a bit harsh, I feel, as I still think Aviator is a pretty neat game... because it is)</li>

							<li>Anreer in galaxy 3: "THE INHABITANTS OF ANREER ARE SO AMAZINGLY PRIMITIVE THAT THEY STILL THINK ***** ****** IS 3D" (the Aviator message was changed to this slightly more cryptic version in the 6502 Second Processor and BBC Master versions; I'm not sure what the starred-out name is here, but my guess is Cylon Attack)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>For the most part, though, extended system descriptions are not overridden, and they employ the "goat soup" recipe. Let's see what that entails.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">The "goat soup" recipe<br>
													 ----------------------</h2>

						<p>The extended system description for a system is displayed by the <a href="/disc/docked/subroutine/pdesc.html">PDESC</a> routine, as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>First, we check for overrides as described above, and if there is an override in place, we show that instead of the "goat soup" string.</li>

							<li>Assuming there is no override, the system's <a href="galaxy_and_system_seeds.html">s1 and s2 16-bit seeds</a> are copied from QQ15(3 2) and QQ15(5 4) into the random number seeds at RAND to RAND+3. This ensures that the <a href="extended_text_tokens.html">ERND tokens</a> that make up the extended system description always choose the same tokens for the same system, as the random numbers generated are always the same.</li>

							<li>Then <a href="/disc/docked/subroutine/detok.html">DETOK</a> is called to print extended token number 5.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Note that in the BBC Micro disc version, extended system descriptions are only shown when docked, as there isn't enough free memory for the PDESC routine during flight. In the advanced versions, where there is more memory available, the extended descriptions are always shown.</p>

						<p>That's it... though that hardly touches on the complexity of the last step, which is a textbook exercise in recursion. Extended token 5 looks like this:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  "{lower case}{justify}{single cap}[86-90] IS [140-144].{cr}{left align}"
</pre>

						<p>Stripping out the formatting, the token is "[86-90] IS [140-144]."</p>

						<p>The first part is pretty easy, as [86-90] expands to one of the following:</p>

						<ul class="tightList">
							<li>86 = {selected system name}</li>

							<li>87 = THE PLANET {selected system name}</li>

							<li>88 = THE WORLD {selected system name}</li>

							<li>89 = THIS PLANET</li>

							<li>90 = THIS WORLD</li>
						</ul>
 
						<p>So Lave starts with token 86 followed by " is " (i.e. "Lave is "), while Reorte and Zaonce start with token 89 and " is " (i.e. "This planet is "). And then we start to expand token [140-144], which leads to a seemingly never-ending Inception-level token-within-token-within-token recursion that can produces some really complex descriptions.</p>

						<p>The fully expanded token tree is shown below, but it's so big that perhaps an example is in order. Here's Lave's extended system description again:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  "Lave is most famous for its vast rain forests and the Lavian tree grub"
</pre>

						<p>This is formed by the following steps, where each step does just one of the following expansions (using the token syntax from the deep dive on <a href="extended_text_tokens.html">the extended text token system</a>):</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Choose a token from a token range (using the ERND token type from the extended text tokens), so for example [61-65] represents a choice of tokens 61-65, and [61] indicates that token 61 is our choice</li>

							<li>Convert a token into its text form, so [23] converts into "most", for example, as that's the text that extended token 23 represents</li>

							<li>Convert a token into a jump token (using the EJMP token type from the extended text tokens), so for example [86] expands into {3}, or jump token 3, which displays the current system name</li>
              
							<li>Expand a token into a collection of other tokens (using the ETOK token type the extended text tokens), so for example [62] expands into "{17} [155-159] [160-164]", which starts with jump token 17, which displays the system name adjective by taking the system name, removing any trailing vowels, and appending "-ian", which in this case gives us "Lavian"</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Here, then, are the steps for displaying the extended system description for Lave:</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">The fully expanded recipe<br>
													 -------------------------</h2>

						<p>The surprisingly large data structure shown below is the fully expanded "goat soup" decision tree, which is responsible for generating all the system descriptions from nothing more than the system seeds and the extended recursive tokens. This is the expanded version of Ian Bell's original worksheet for the recipe, which is shown <a href="http://www.elitehomepage.org/design/">in the fourth image on his design page</a>; not surprisingly, his tree spilled off the bottom of the sheet of paper. Note that the tree below contains the correct spelling of "weird", which was misspelled as "wierd" in the disc and 6502 Second Processor versions, but was fixed in the BBC Master version.</p>

						<p>It's worth remembering that this entire tree comes from the simple command to print extended token 5, and it's a great example of super-efficient procedural generation as applied to the English language. The edible poets would be proud, I'm sure.</p>
