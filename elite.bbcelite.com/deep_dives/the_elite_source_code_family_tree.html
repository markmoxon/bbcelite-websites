C64 version released mid-April 1985 (according to ZZap issue 1)
6502SP 25 July 1985, but developed first

Good examples of 6502SP then C64:
PUTBACK: https://elite.bbcelite.com/c64/main/subroutine/setyc.html
DOXC: https://elite.bbcelite.com/c64/main/subroutine/doxc.html
SETXC: https://elite.bbcelite.com/c64/main/subroutine/setyc.html
TTX66 around JSR PBZE
All these come from 6502SP and are very SP-specific

Good example of Apple then Master (not the other way around):
 LDA BOMB               \ If we already set off our energy bomb...
 
Plus SCALEX, SCALEY were invented for Apple and stubbed for Master
