						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">Memory usage in the Apple II version of Elite</h2>

						<p>On its launch in 1977, the most powerful version of the Apple II came with a whopping 48K of RAM, and Elite needs almost all of it. Once the game is loaded, there are only 422 spare bytes in the entire machine, spread out between four small pockets of free space.</p>

						<p>This is not that surprising, as the Apple version is a development of the Commodore 64 version, which itself takes up most of that machine's generous 64K of RAM. Gone are the music and sprites of the Commodore version, and the Trumbles mission and Cougar ship blueprint are also axed, but those features aside, Apple Elite manages to pack everything into memory at once.</p>

						<p>Let's see how it does it.</p>

						<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Apple II version of Elite is that it includes its own low-level disk access routines. To enable the game to load and save commander files without giving away all the memory required by the official version of Apple DOS, the game includes its own copy of the RWTS (Read Write Track Sector) routines, taken from Apple DOS 3.3 and modified to include only the features that are required. These routines use the same memory as the ship heap at K% for the disk buffers, which works because we don't need to access the disk while flying.</p>

						<p>Similarly, the WP workspace is designed so it only contains graphics-related variables, such as the stardust coordinates, the ball line heap and the sun line heap. This means it can share memory with the text screen memory, as we are either showing the text screen or the graphics screen, but never both at the same time.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Elite code as an image<br>
													 ----------------------</h2>

						<p>To see just how big Appple II Elite is, we can convert the main game binary into an image, with one byte per pixel, and a greyscale showing each byte's value, with 0 being shown as black, 255 being shown as white, and interim values as greyscale pixels. The result is a 196-pixel square, like this (shown here at double size, so you can see the pixels more clearly):</p>
