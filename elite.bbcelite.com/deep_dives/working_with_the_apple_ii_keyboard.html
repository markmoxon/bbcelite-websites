Only the IIe had joystick ports II and II+ had a 16-pin DIP on the motherboard - mention this in keyboard article?

On the II and II Plus, the best that you can do is determine that no key
is being pressed when you read the keyboard for input. You would have to
save the ASCII code of the last key press, and then when you read the
keyboard for input, but find no keypress, you assume that that last key
pressed has been released. However, because the keyboard doesn't auto
repeat, the user could still be holding down that key!

I recall most II and II Plus era games had a separate key to stop movement.
This no doubt stems from the limitation that their keyboard is not
auto-repeat. You can tell from software that a key was pressed, but you
can't tell for how long it was pressed, or if it is still pressed.




Apple II keyboard only notices key down, not hold down or key up: "You can tell from software that a key was pressed, but you can't tell for how long it was pressed, or if it is still pressed."

no repeat (REPT key does this using a hardware 555 timer)

$C000 = one byte containing ASCII of last key pressed
bit 7 set if this is new data since the last time we cleared the strobe

Elite does not read the any-key-down bit 7 from $C010, as it isn't supported on Apple II, only later models - it only accesses it to clear the strobe to signal fetching of the next key press

THIS IS WHY WE USE JOYSTICKS
