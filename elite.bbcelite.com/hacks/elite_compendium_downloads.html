						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">How to download and play the Elite Compendium</h2>

						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/elite_compendium/transporter.png" alt="A Transporter leaving the space station on the BBC Master in the Elite Compendium">

						<p>You can play the Elite Compendium in a web browser, or on a BBC Master 128, BBC Micro or Acorn Electron (for the BBC Micro you'll need a model B or B+ with 16K of sideways RAM, or a B+128; for the Electron you'll need 16K of sideways RAM).</p>

						<p>Here are the options for playing in your browser:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Play the BBC Master version of the Elite Compendium <a href="https://bbc.xania.org/?model=Master&amp;autoboot&amp;disc=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-master.dsd">in your browser</a>. This link will work for all but the 6502 Second Processor version; if you want to play the latter, <a href="https://bbc.xania.org/?model=Master&amp;coProcessor=true&amp;autoboot&amp;disc=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-master.dsd">you'll need this link</a>.</li>

							<li>Play the BBC Micro version of the Elite Compendium <a href="https://bbc.xania.org/?autoboot&amp;disc=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-micro.dsd">in your browser</a>. This link will work for all but the 6502 Second Processor version and Elite Universe Editor; if you want to play these, <a href="https://bbc.xania.org/?coProcessor=true&amp;autoboot&amp;disc=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-micro.dsd">you'll need this link</a>.</li>

							<li>Play the Acorn Electron version of the Elite Compendium <a href="https://0xc0de6502.github.io/electroniq/?dfs&amp;autoboot&amp;ram6&amp;disk0=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-acorn-electron.ssd">in your browser</a>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>And here are the options for downloading the game:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Download the Elite Compendium as a double-sided <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-master.dsd">DSD disc image for the BBC Master</a> or a double-sided <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-micro.dsd">DSD disc image for the BBC Micro</a>. This will run in an emulator, or on a real BBC Master or BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.</li>

							<li>Download the Elite Compendium as two single-sided SSD disc images for the BBC Master (<a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-master-drive-0.ssd">drive 0</a> and <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-master-drive-2.ssd">drive 2</a>) or BBC Micro (<a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-micro-drive-0.ssd">drive 0</a> and <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-bbc-micro-drive-2.ssd">drive 2</a>). This is for systems that do not support DSD images, like the Turbo MMC and Micro SPI SD card systems.</li>

							<li>Download the Elite Compendium as a single-sided <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-acorn-electron.ssd">SSD disc image for the Acorn Electron with DFS or MMFS</a> or a single-sided <a href="/versions/elite_compendium/elite-compendium-acorn-electron.adf">ADF disc image for the Acorn Electron with ADFS</a>. This will run in an emulator, or on a real Electron using a device like an SD card.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you're playing in a browser, just click the relevant link above and the Elite Compendium will automatically load and show you the menu. If you want to use a disc image, then:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If you're playing the BBC version in an emulator or on a real machine using a device like a Gotek, insert the DSD disc image into drive 0 and press SHIFT-D-BREAK (or SHIFT-D-F12 on most emulators).</li>

							<li>If you are using a system like the Turbo MMC or Micro SPI to play the BBC version, first add the two SSD images to your SD card, and then use the *DRIVE and *DIN commands to load the images into drive 0 and drive 2. You can then load the Compendium by booting from drive 0, using either SHIFT-M-BREAK (for MMFS), SHIFT-S-BREAK (for Micro SPI) or the *DBOOT command.</li>

							<li>For the Electron version, simply add the SSD image to your SD card, and then use SHIFT-M-BREAK or the *DBOOT command to boot the disc. For the ADFS version, insert the ADF image and use SHIFT-A-BREAK.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Once loaded, the menu system will show you all the available options. You can either read more information by highlighting an option and pressing the left or right arrow, or you can choose which option to run by pressing RETURN.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>For the BBC Master version, all options work on a standard BBC Master 128 except for 6502 Second Processor Elite, which needs a BBC Master Turbo (i.e. a BBC Master 128 with an internal 65C102 Second Processor) or a BBC Master 128 with an external 6502 Second Processor.</li>

							<li>For the BBC Micro version, all options work on a BBC Micro with 16K of sideways RAM except for 6502 Second Processor Elite (which needs sideways RAM and a 6502 Second Processor) and the Elite Universe Editor (which needs a 6502 Second Processor).</li>

							<li>The menu only applies to the BBC version; the Electron version only contains one game at present, which needs 16K of sideways RAM. See the <a href="elite_compendium_acorn_electron.html">Compendium version of Acorn Electron Elite</a> for details of the various sideways RAM options for the Electron.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Commander files for the game are on drive 0, while universe files for the Universe Editor are on drive 2. When playing Teletext Elite or BBC Micro Elite, ensure that the disc is inserted when launching or docking, so the game can load the correct files (just as with the original BBC Micro disc version).</p>

						<p>Note that the Elite Compendium needs sideways RAM, so it is not suitable for an unexpanded BBC Micro or Acorn Electron. Also, note that not all BBC Micro sideways RAM solutions are supported (see the section below for more details).</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Using a Delta 14B joystick<br>
													 --------------------------</h2>

						<p>All versions of Elite in the BBC Micro and BBC Master Compendiums support the Voltmace Delta 14B joystick and Delta 14B/1 adaptor box:</p>

						<img class="titleImage photo" style="width: 400px" src="/images/elite_compendium/delta_14b_and_adaptor.jpg" alt="The Voltmace Delta 14B joystick and 14B/1 adaptor box">

						<p>The Compendium lets you use the buttons on the Delta 14B for the most important flight controls, so you don't have to keep reaching for the keyboard. You use the joystick part for flying and moving the chart crosshairs, and you use the buttons for the following:</p>

						<img class="titleImage lightBorder" style="width: 248px" src="/images/elite_compendium/delta_14b_buttons.png" alt="Delta 14B buttons in the Elite Compendium">

						<p>You can download <a href="/pdfs/Elite-Compendium-Delta-14B-controls.pdf">a PDF of these controls</a> for easy reference, or here they are in text form:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">  Fire laser                                    Fire laser
  Slow down              Fire laser             Speed up
  Unarm missile          Fire missile           Target missile
  Front view             E.C.M.                 Rear view
  Docking computer off   In-system jump         Docking computer on
</pre>

						<p>To get all this working, you will need both a Delta 14B joystick and a Delta 14B/1 adaptor box, as well as a real BBC Micro or BBC Master, as no emulators currently support the Delta 14B system. If you don't already have these, then the joysticks pop up on eBay reasonably regularly, but the adaptor box can be really hard to find. Luckily you can buy modern reproductions of the 14B/1 from Stardot legend ukwebb; see <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=24981">this Stardot thread</a> for details. I have one of his adaptor boxes (it's in the picture above), and I can highly recommend it.</p>

						<p>To set everything up for Elite, first make sure your computer is switched off, and then connect the 14B/1 adaptor box to the analogue port and plug the ribbon cable into the user port. Next, attach your Delta 14B joystick to the rear socket; don't attach it to the side socket, as that isn't supported.</p>

						<p>Now load any version of Elite from the Compendium and start the game. While you are still docked, configure the game to use the Delta 14B by pausing the game with COPY, pressing "L" (which will give a confirmation beep), and then pressing DELETE to unpause the game. You can now enjoy the future of gaming, 1984-style.</p>

						<p>To switch back to the keyboard, repeat the COPY-L-DELETE process. You can still use the keyboard controls while using the Delta 14B, with the exception of the steering, which has to be done with the stick.</p>

						<p>Note that because the Elite Compendium supports instant docking when you have a docking computer fitted, so does the Delta 14B. To dock instantly, simply press the bottom-right button to enable the docking computer, and then press the middle-bottom button to skip the docking sequence and dock. This is about as convenient as docking gets...</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader">Notes on sideways RAM<br>
													 ---------------------</h2>

						<p>When loading Elite, the Compendium will check for the presence of sideways RAM, and if successful it will load a ROM image into sideways RAM and ask you to press a key to play the game. If the game can't find any sideways RAM, then it will tell you and give up. Note that your sideways RAM must be writeable, so if you are on a BBC Micro and have a read/write switch fitted, make sure it's in the write-enable position.</p>

						<p>Note that on the BBC Micro, the game will only work with sideways RAM that uses the ROMSEL latch at SHEILA &amp;FE30 to switch banks. The BBC Master's sideways RAM is fine, but some types of BBC Micro sideways RAM use the RAMSEL latch at SHEILA &amp;FE32, while others use the user port at SHEILA &amp;FE60 and &amp;FE62, and I'm afraid there just isn't enough free memory in Elite to support all these different styles of sideways RAM. In particular, owners of Solidisk or Watford Electronics sideways RAM may be out of luck here.</p>

						<p>The Acorn Electron should be fine, as all the sideways RAM systems work in the same way.  See the <a href="elite_compendium_acorn_electron.html">Compendium version of Acorn Electron Elite</a> for details of the various sideways RAM options for the Electron.</p>

						<h2 class="articleSubheader"><a id="issues" class="anchor"></a>Known issues<br>
													 ------------</h2>

						<p>On the BBC Master, the buttons on the Delta 14B can sometimes be a little flaky (though the BBC Micro is fine). Specifically, if you press the "go faster" button in the top-right, it can sometimes trigger the "target missile" button just below it. I've also seen it trigger the "rear view" button below that, but this is rarer. This is more of an annoyance than a problem, but it's worth knowing about.</p>

						<p>On the Acorn Electron, the disc catalogue gets a bit scrambled in version 2.00 of the ACP DFS (it works but is pretty hard to read). Upgrading to version 2.20 fixes this.</p>
