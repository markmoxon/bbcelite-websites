						<p>The <a href="elite_compendium.html">Elite Compendium</a> is a great way to enjoy Teletext Elite in combination with my other hacks - see the <a href="elite_compendium_downloads.html">download page</a> for details. Or you can play Teletext Elite by choosing one of the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Play Teletext Elite <a href="https://bbc.xania.org/?autoboot&amp;disc=https://elite.bbcelite.com/versions/teletext_elite/teletext-elite.ssd">in your browser</a>.</li>

							<li>Download Teletext Elite <a href="/versions/teletext_elite/teletext-elite.ssd">as a multi-format disc image</a> that will run in an emulator, or on a real BBC Micro or BBC Master 128 using a device like a Gotek.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>To load Teletext Elite on a BBC, simply insert the disc image and press SHIFT-D-BREAK (or SHIFT-D-F12 on most emulators). The disc will automatically load if you're playing it in a browser.</p>

						<p>The controls in Teletext Elite are identical to standard BBC Micro Elite. For details, you can read the <a href="http://www.elitehomepage.org/manual.htm">original game manual on Ian Bell's website</a>. You can also check out the <a href="teletext_elite_instructions.html">instructions</a> for information on some of the subtle differences between the teletext version and the original.</p>
