													 --------------------------------------</h2>

						<p>The Universe Editor lets you customise pretty much every aspect of the Elite universe, from the ships around you to the seeds used to generate the game's systems and galaxies. Here's what you can do, all within the original game engine:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#adding">Compose your universe</a> by placing ships, planets, suns and space stations</a> anywhere within the local bubble, with a fully featured 3D editor that uses the game's original interface and <a href="elite_universe_editor_summary_of_keys.html">key presses</a> that will be familiar to players of BBC Micro Elite.</li>

							<li><a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#attributes">Edit the many different attributes for each ship</a>, such as AI, ship personality, speed, turn rates, laser fire, missiles, E.C.M., station type, planet type and so on.</li>

							<li><a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#saving">Save and load</a> universe files.</li>

							<li><a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#saving">Play your universes</a> by jumping straight into the game engine with your chosen universe laid out around you. Build a scenario and watch it come to life, or <a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#example">load one of the sample universes</a> that come bundled with the editor, like the iconic screenshot from the back of the BBC Micro box:

								<img class="titleImage" src="/images/elite_universe_editor/boxart2.png" alt="Creating the screenshot from the original BBC Micro box in the Elite Universe Editor" />

								or the screenshot from the back of the original Commodore 64 box:

								<img class="titleImage c64" src="/images/elite_universe_editor_c64/boxartc.png" alt="Creating the screenshot from the original Commodore 64 box in the Elite Universe Editor" />
							</li>

							<li><a href="elite_universe_editor_instructions_bbc.html#seeds">Edit the galaxy seeds</a> to explore the 281,474,976,710,656 different galaxies that the engine supports.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The Universe Editor is a "mod" in the real sense of the word - it modifies the original Elite, which is still present in the Universe Editor in its full form. When you play a universe file, it drops you into the game itself with your current commander loaded, as if you had been there all along.</p>
