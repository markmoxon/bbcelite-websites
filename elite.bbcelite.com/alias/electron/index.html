						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/general/Elite-Electron.png" alt="Electron Elite screenshot" />

						<p>Although it isn't a BBC-branded machine, the Acorn Electron is very much cut from the same cloth as the BBC Micro, so it's no surprise that Elite was released for the Electron only a matter of weeks after the original BBC Micro version.</p>
       
						<p>Unfortunately, because the Electron doesn't contain a 6845 CRTC chip like the BBC Micro, the screen mode can't be reprogrammed in the same way, so the memory-saving square screen mode of the BBC version had to be dropped, along with a few core features that would no longer fit into the reduced memory available.</p>
           
						<p>The Electron version of Elite is essentially a cut-down version of the <a href="/cassette/">cassette version</a> that's missing the split-screen mode, suns and Thargoids, but otherwise it is still very much Elite. It is also noticeably slower than the BBC Micro version, but that arguably makes it a bit easier to play.</p>
