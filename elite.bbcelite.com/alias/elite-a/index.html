						<img class="titleImage" src="/images/elite-a/encyclopedia_iguana.png" alt="Elite-A screenshot" />

						<p>Elite-A is Angus Duggan's epic extended version of Elite, and is a must-play for fans of the original.</p>

						<p>In the late 1980s, only a few years after the original game was launched, Angus took the BBC Micro <a href="/disc/">disc version</a>, decrypted it, and disassembled it using his own hand-rolled assembly ROM fitted to a BBC Micro with a 6502 Second Processor. He then reassembled it (again with his own ROM), but only after adding an impressive array of extra features, including a unique set of new ship designs, the ability to buy and fly a selection of different ships, special cargo transport missions, an encyclopedia packed full of Elite lore, a faster version that runs on the 6502 Second Processor, and more.</p>
            
						<p>It's an 8-bit coding <i>tour de force</i>, and comes highly recommended. Ian Bell, co-author of the original Elite, has this to say on his website:</p>

						<blockquote class="articleIndented">
							<p>Also available here is Angus Duggan's Elite-A, a comprehensive enhancement of BBC Elite. He created this by disassembling the object code and then reprogramming the resultant source. A significant achievement for which respect is due.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Angus used Acornsoft's VIEW word processor as his IDE, and built the whole thing without the benefit of modern tooling. A significant achievement, indeed.</p>

						<p>I am very grateful to Angus for giving me permission to analyse his work on Elite-A, and for providing me with the original source files.</p>
