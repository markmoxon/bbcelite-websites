						<h2 class="articleSubheader deepDive">Drawing the clock-like indicators on the dashboard</h2>

						<p>The dashboard in Aviator is a thing of beauty that not only looks the part, but manages to convey a lot of complex information about the current flight model in a succinct and effective manner. The most common dashboard control is the clock-like dial used for the airspeed indicator, altitude indicator, compass, vertical speed indicator and slip-and-turn indicator, so let's see how this dial works under the hood.</p>

						<p>The core is the <a href="/source/main/subroutine/gethandvector.html">GetHandVector</a> routine, which performs a calculation to work out the vector for a dial indicator hand, given a value to show on the dial. It calculates this using a simple triangle model - there's no trigonometry here.</p>

						<p>First, we work out which quadrant of the dial we want to draw the hand in, and set the direction in R accordingly. We do this by repeatedly subtracting the range of a single quadrant from the value to show, counting quadrants as we go, until we go past zero, at which point we know which quadrant the dial hand is in.</p>

						<p>Then we work out the vector from the centre point of the dial to the end of the hand, using a simple triangle. Imagine the possible positions of the end of the dial hand as a vertical diamond shape, like this:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">                         ^                         ^
                       .´ `.                       |`. (x, y)
                     .´     `.  r                  |  /.
                   .´         `.                   | /  `.
                 .´             `.                 |/     `.
                <        +        >                +--------> 
                 `.             .´          (0, 0)     w
                   `.         .´
                     `.     .´
                       `. .´
                         v
</pre>

						<p>It doesn't necessarily look like it in in ASCII, but imagine that the diamond is a rotated square, so all the angles are right angles.</p>

						<p>If the end of our hand is always on the outside of the diamond shape above, then if we consider the top-right quadrant, the equation of the edge line is given by y = - x + w. So as the hand goes from pointing straight up to pointing to the right (12 o'clock to 3 o'clock), x goes from 0 to w, y goes from w to 3, and y = x - w. For the next quadrant down, 3 to 6 o'clock, we can negate y to get y = -(x - w) = w - x, and we can do a similar sign switch for the other two quadrants.</p>

						<p>So, given an x-coordinate for our hand, we can work out the y-coordinate using y = x - w or y = w - x, depending on the quadrant. And if we choose to set the origin at the centre of the dial, then the x- and y-coordinates are effectively x and y-deltas, which is what we need to generate in order to use the routine at <a href="/source/main/subroutine/drawvectorline_part_1_of_3.html">DrawVectorLine</a> to draw the hand on the dial.</p>

						<p>Finally, if we apply a simple cap to the values of x and y, this has the effect of "blunting" the corners of the diamond, like this:</p>

<pre class="articleIndented">                     _______
                   .´       `.
                  |           |
                  |     +     |
                  |           |
                   `._______.´
</pre>

						<p>It turns out that this kind of approximation for the movement of a dial hand is pretty good, even though it isn't describing anything like a perfect circle. If you look carefully, you can see the dial hands describe this exact shape as they move around their dials; it's a clever trick that makes life much simpler for the programmer, but without making it obvious.</p>
