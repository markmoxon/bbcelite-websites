						<p>This site contains reconstructed source code for The Sentinel, Geoff Crammond's classic proto-VR game for the BBC Micro, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about The Sentinel and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate this uniquely atmospheric curveball from this legend of gaming simulations.</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not Geoff Crammond's original source code, as that hasn't been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that's been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

						                             --------------------------</h2>

						<p>To start your journey into the secrets of The Sentinel, you might like to try the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>See the <a href="/about_site/quick_start_guide.html">quick start guide</a> to find out how to use this site.</li>

							<li>Find out how to <a href="/playing_the_sentinel/">play The Sentinel in your browser</a> or by using an emulator.</li>

							<li>Read more <a href="/about_site/about_this_project.html">about this project</a> and how it came to be.</li>

							<!--<li>Check out the <a href="/deep_dives/">deep dive articles</a> for lots of details about how The Sentinel works under the hood.</li>-->

							<li>Dive straight into the <a href="/source/articles/map_of_the_source_code.html">source code</a>, though you might want to <a href="/about_site/terminology_used_in_this_commentary.html">read these notes</a> first, which explain some of the terminology used in the commentary.</li>

							<li>Jump straight to a <a href="/cgi-bin/random.cgi">random routine from the source code</a> - who knows where you might end up? You can also click the &#x221E; at the top of the page to keep jumping through the source code; it's a good way to explore.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you prefer a lighter theme for your Sentinel explorations, you can change the site's colour scheme by clicking the icons in the top-right corner.</p>

						                             ---------------------------------</h2>

						<p>If you are interested in building a working copy of The Sentinel from the source, then you'll enjoy exploring the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/the-sentinel-source-code-bbc-micro">accompanying GitHub repository</a>, which contains fully commented and buildable source code for The Sentinel.</p>

						<p>This repository can be <a href="/about_site/building_the_sentinel.html">assembled on modern computers</a> to produce a working game disc that can be loaded into a BBC Micro or an emulator. If you want to experiment with the code, this is the place to go.</p>
