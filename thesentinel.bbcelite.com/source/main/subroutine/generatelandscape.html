 This routine populates the tileData table with tile data for each of the tile
 corners in the landscape. The landscape consists of 31x31 square tiles, made
 up of a 32x32 grid of tile corners.

 One byte of tile data is generated for each tile corner in the landscape. Each
 byte of tile data contains two pieces of information:

   * The low nibble of each byte contains the tile shape, which describes the
     layout and structure of the landscape on that tile.

   * The high nibble of each byte contains the altitude of the tile corner in
     the front-left corner of the tile (i.e. the corner closest to the
     landscape origin). We call this tile corner the "anchor".

 As each tile is defined by a tile corner and a shape, we tend to use the terms
 "tile" and "tile corner" interchangeably, depending on the context. That said,
 for tile corners along the furthest back and rightmost edges of the landscape,
 the shape data is ignored, as there is no landscape beyond the edges.

 See the GetTileShape routine for information on the different types of tile
 shape.
