 At this point we have generated the landscape and populated it with enemies,
 the player and trees, all using the landscape's sequence of seed numbers. This
 sequence will be different for each individual level, but will be exactly the
 same sequence every time we generate a specific level.

 We now keep generating the landscape's sequence of seed numbers to get the
 landscape's secret code, as follows:

   * Generate another 38 numbers from the sequence

   * The next four numbers in the sequence form the secret code

 To get a secret code of the form 12345678, we take the last four numbers and
 convert them into binary coded decimal (BCD) by using the GetNextSeedAsBCD
 routine. These four two-digit pairs then form the secret code, with each of
 the four numbers producing a pair of digits, building up the secret code from
 left to right (so in the order that they are written down).

 If we are displaying the landscape number on-screen at the end of a level,
 then the last four numbers are generated in the SpawnSecretCode3D routine, but
 if we are checking the secret code entered by the player, then we generate the
 last four numbers in this routine (plus one extra number that is ignored).
 This behaviour is controlled by the doNotPlayLandscape variable.
