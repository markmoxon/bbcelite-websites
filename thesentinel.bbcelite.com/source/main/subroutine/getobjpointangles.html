 This routine loops through each point in an object definition and calculates
 the following:

 1. A: Calculate the yaw angle of the point, rotated by the rotation of the
 object itself (i.e. its gaze), so this is the yaw angle of the object point
 within the object, but with the correct rotation for the direction the object
 is facing.

 2. xDelta(Hi Lo), zDelta(Hi Lo): Convert this yaw angle and the polar distance
 into x- and z-coordinates for the point in the y = 0 plane (i.e. on the
 ground) using cos(A) and sin(A) on a triangle with the line along the polar
 distance to the point as the hypotenuse. So these are the x- and z-coordinates
 of the object point within the object itself (i.e. relative to the object's
 origin and rotated to the correct gaze).

 3. angle(Hi Lo): Calculate the angle of the right-angled triangle made up of
 the object point's object-relative x- and z-coordinates, to give us the angle
 of the vector from the object's origin to the to the point within the object.

 4. drawViewYaw(Hi Lo): Rotate the yaw angle of the point within the object
 definition by the object's view-relative yaw angle to get the view-relative
 yaw angle of the point. This is the yaw angle of the vector from the viewer to
 the object point.

 5. drawViewPitch(Hi Lo): Construct the vertical triangle that has the vector
 from the viewer to the point as the hypotenuse, the point altitude as the
 opposite side and the projection onto the ground of the vector as the adjacent
 side, and use this to calculate the pitch angle of the vector from the viewer
 to the object point.
