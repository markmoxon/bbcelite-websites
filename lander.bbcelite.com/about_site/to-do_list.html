						<p>I have documented every byte of the Lander game code, but that doesn't mean that I've fully <i>understood</i> every byte (though it's close). Almost every single aspect of the code is explained, but there are a few issues that could benefit from another look.</p>

						<p>This page lists all of the outstanding issues of which I am aware. These are the notes I made as I analysed the source, so they are fairly terse and might not be terribly clear.</p>
